__Application observability__ is about aggregating, correlating and analyzing the following key elements:<br>

>- __Logs__ with application execution details and data.<br>
>- __The requests and operations structure__ (sometimes also referred as __Activity, Traces or Spans__) with the structure of application calls, related to an event or exception condition.<br>
>- __Metrics__: numeric values (such as latencies, payload sizes, frequencies) that can be aggregated and correlated with the operations structure and the logs.<br>

The image below shows examples about the __3 observability elements__ into __local text based streams__:<br>

Diginsight __makes observability easy__ as:<br>
>- it __integrates the 3 observability elements__ (Log, Traces, Metrics) into high performance __text-based streams__ such as traditional `File logs`, the `Console log` or the `Azure Streaming log`.<br>
>- it __publishes the 3 observability elements__ to `OpenTelemetry` and allowing application analysis by means of remote APM tools such as __Azure Monitor__ and __Grafana__.<br>

## Additional Information
Application flow observability is provided leveraging existing __.Net__ __ILogger__ and __System Diagnostics__ classes so that diginsight telemetry can be mixed and analyzed with other components telemetry, as long as they rely on the same standard framework classes.<br>
Observability for remote tools is provided by means of __OpenTelemetry__ so that telemetry data can be targeted to __Azure Monitor__ and also other analysis tools such as __Prometheus__/__Graphana__.

Diginsight application flow rendering is:
- __consistent across tools__: every information or metric visible on the __local text based streams__ can be published and observed on the __remote analysis tools__ (eg. on Appinsight Transaction detail or Appinsight Metrics).
![alt text](<00.01 - Observability Concepts/001.01 Consistency across tools.png>)

- __consistent with code__: the application flow is published with information about classes, method names and call nesting so the __'gap' from telemetry and code__ is shortened for __application developers__ and __site reliability engineers__.
![alt text](<00.01 - Observability Concepts/001.02 Consistency with code.png>)

- __consistent across applications__ application flow published in the same way for all applications. so it is __easily readable for peopble without background knowledge__ on the application logic.

Diginsight __log layout__ and __automatic rendering__ for entities can be fully customized to ensure best readability of the application flow.

Paragraph [Getting Started](<../00. Getting Started/Getting Started.md>) discusses basic steps we can follow to integrate diginsight telemetry.
