title: "HowTo: Use dynamic logging to manage loglevel dinamically, at runtime"
---

__diginsight telemetry__ supports __dynamic logging__ to hot switch the minimum log level (e.g. from Information or Warning to Debug or Trace levels) of any log category.<br>

To minimize telemetry cost and performance impact, telemetry sent to the remote tools is normally limited to LogLevels __Critical__, __Warning__ or __Information__.<br>

The snippet below shows a tipical Logging section configuration for a production environment:
```json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
  }
}
```

__Using Diginsight telemetry__ on a Web API or Web Application, the __log level__ for any category __can be overridden at runtime, for a single call, by means of the `Log-Level` http request headers__.

## Additional Information 

The image below shows the logstream for a web API where only __Critical__, __Warning__ and __Information__ and levels are enabled.

While the application is running the streaming log shows only __limited (or no) information about the application execution flow__.

In case we need to troubleshoot a specific application call flow, it is possible to reporduce the call specifying __different log levels for some categories__:

__This will result in the full application flow being shown__ for the specific call:

> this way, every call application flow can be easily __isolated__ and __analized__ on a live server, that is processing other calls at the same time.

## HowTo Enable Dynamic Loggging
Dynamic logging can be enabled adding the following stagement:<br>
`services.AddDynamicLogLevel<DefaultDynamicLogLevelInjector>();`
to the `ConfigureServices` methods, in the __application startup sequence__.

The image below shows that statement into startup sequence of the `S01_00_SampleWebAPI` project, within diginsight [telemetry.samples](https://github.com/diginsight/telemetry.samples) repository:<br>
