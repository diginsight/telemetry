## HowTo: Configure diginsight telemetry to the local text based streams
You can ottain a __console log__ or __file log__ with diginsight by means of the steps shown below.<br>

The code snippets are available as working samples within the [telemetry.samples](https://github.com/diginsight/telemetry.samples) repository.<br>
Article [HOWTO - Use Diginsight Samples.md](<15.00 - HowTo - Use Diginsight Samples.md>): explores how we can use diginsight samples to test and understand integration of Diginsight telemetry in our own projects.

## STEP 01 - Add a package reference to the package `Diginsight.Diagnostics` or `Diginsight.Diagnostics.Log4Net`
In the first step you can just add a diginsight reference to your code:<br>
![alt text](<01.00 - Configure diginsight telemetry to the local text based streams/001.01 STEP1 - add reference.png>)
reference to `Diginsight.Diagnostics` is needed for the __Console log__ and `Diginsight.Diagnostics.Log4Net` is required to enable Log4Net __File log__.<br>


## STEP 02 - Configure logging within the Startup sequence
In the second step you can configure the startup sequence to enable  diginsight log:
````c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    var services = builder.Services;
    var configuration = builder.Configuration;
    var environment = builder.Environment;

    // Add logging providers
    services.AddObservability(configuration, environment);

    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
    services.AddSwaggerGen();

    // Use diginsight service provider 
    // this enables telemetry initialization at service provider creation
    builder.Host.UseDiginsightServiceProvider(true);
    WebApplication app = builder.Build();

    if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseSwagger();
        app.UseSwaggerUI();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();

    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.MapControllers();

    app.Run();
}
````

in the code above: 
- __AddObservability()__ is used to add log to the application Console and a log4net file log.
- __UseDiginsightServiceProvider()__ is used to activate diginsight during the service provider build() process.

Please note that __AddObservability()__ is implemented as an extension method that calls __AddLogging()__ with:
- __AddDiginsightConsole()__: this methods configures the __Console log__ provider with some formatting options
![alt text](<02.00 - Configure diginsight telemetry to the remote tools/002.01 STEP2 - AddDiginsightConsole.png>)

- __AddDiginsightLog4Net()__: this methods configures a rolling __File log__ on the user profile folder.
![alt text](<02.00 - Configure diginsight telemetry to the remote tools/002.02 STEP2 - AddDiginsightLog4Net.png>)

<br>

The code above loads telemety based on the __Diginsight:Activities__ configuration section that includes the  enabled __ActivitySources__ and their __LogBehavior__. <br>
```json#
"Diginsight": {
    "Activities": {
        "LogBehavior": "Show",
        "MeterName": "SampleWebAPI",
        "ActivitySources": {
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": true,
        "System.Net.Http": true,
        "Experimental.*": false,
        "Diginsight.*": true,
        "SampleWebAPI": true
        },
        "LoggedActivityNames": {
        "System.Net.Http|System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut": "Hide",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.HttpRequestIn": "Hide"
        }
    }
}
```
Activities __LogBehavior__ can be set to:
- __Show__: the activity is logged.
- __Hide__: the activity is not logged.
- __Truncate__: the activity and all __inner activities called within its scope__ are not logged.


## STEP 03 - Add telemetry to code with `StartMethodActivity()` and `ILogger` Statements
We are now ready to add instrumentation to the code and make the application flow observable.<br>

The snippet below shows how to add telemetry to the `GetWeatherForecast()` method of the `WeatherForecastController` class:
```c#
[HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
{
    // send method START and END events with Observability.ActivitySource
    using var activity = Observability.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger);

    var randomTemperature = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55);
    // add to logger.LogDebug to send a log event
    logger.LogDebug("randomTemperature: {randomTemperature}", randomTemperature);

    var res = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
    {
        Date = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)),
        TemperatureC = randomTemperature,
        Summary = Summaries[Random.Shared.Next(Summaries.Length)]
    }).ToArray();

    activity?.SetOutput(res);
    return res;
}
```
in the snippet above:
- `using var activity = Observability.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger);` is added to provide observability of method start and end
- `logger.LogDebug("randomTemperature: {randomTemperature}", randomTemperature);` is usd to log the randomTemperature value, during the method execution.
- `activity.SetOutput(result);` is used to add the method result to the method END event.<br>

## STEP 04 - run your code and look at the resulting application flow 
The image below shows the application flow generated by DoSomeWork method 
The image belpw shows the sample method execution, where 
- method start and end are logged with the __Method__ name, 
- randomTemperature is logged as a standard variable value and 
- the __method result__ is logged within the method END raw.<br>

## STEP 03 (Full) - Add telemetry for the startup sequence 
The `S01_01_SampleWebAPIWithStartupSequence` sample shows an example WebApi where telemetry is enabled also for the full startup sequence.

An `ObservabilityManager` is created with a `LoggerFactory` to record telemetry events until the ASP.NET Core Service Provider creation.<br>
When the Service Provider is created, __the recorded startup telemetry is sent to the configured registered providers__ (eg. Console, Log4Net).<br>
__In case of Exceptions__ during the startup sequence, __telemetry is flushed to the Console/log4net by means of an emergency service provider__, managed by the Observability manager.<br>

```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // this enables sending telemetry for the startup sequence
    // telemetry is recorded until ServiceProvider creation
    // after that, recorded telemetry is sent to the configured registered providers
    // (eg. AzureMonitor, Console, Log4Net) 
    using var observabilityManager = new ObservabilityManager();
    ILogger logger = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger(typeof(Program));
    Observability.LoggerFactory = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory;

    WebApplication app;
    using (var activity = Observability.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, new { args }))
    {
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
        var services = builder.Services;
        var configuration = builder.Configuration;
        var environment = builder.Environment;

        // Add logging and opentelemetry providers
        services.AddObservability(configuration, environment, out IOpenTelemetryOptions openTelemetryOptions);

        // registers recorded telemetry for flush after ServiceProvider creation
        observabilityManager.AttachTo(services);

        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
        services.AddSwaggerGen();

        // use diginsight service provider 
        // this enables telemetry initialization at service provider creation
        builder.Host.UseDiginsightServiceProvider(true);
        app = builder.Build();

        if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseSwagger();
            app.UseSwaggerUI();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();

        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.MapControllers();
    }

    app.Run();
}
```

## STEP 04 (Full) - run your code and look at the resulting application flow 
The image below shows the application flow generated by the startup sequence.<br>
In particular, `Program.Main()` method is logged with registration details of `AddObservability()` method.<br>,
