## Use Dynamic-Configuration to manage configurations and feature flags dynamically at runtime

__Diginsight telemetry__ supports __dynamic configuration__ to hot switch configuration values, based on http headers (or other information).<br>
As an example, lets assume that a Web Application implements a __concurrency option__ such as the following:

```json
"AppSettings": {
  "MaxConcurrency": 10,
}
```
With diginsight, the developer can __register such a configuration__ so that __it can be overridden at runtime by means of  the `Dynamic-Configuration` http request header__, for specific calls.<br>

The following paragraphs show how to reguster and use such a __dynamic configuration__.<br>
The following code snippets can be found into the `S01_00_SampleWebAPI` project in Diginsight [telemetry.samples](https://github.com/diginsight/telemetry.samples) repository.


## Additional information

The snippet below, shows the `ConcurrencyOptions` class used for loading the MaxConcurrency settings.<br>
A marker interface `IDynamicallyConfigurable` is used to mark the class as __dynamically configurable__.<br>

```c#
public class ConcurrencyOptions : IDynamicallyConfigurable
{
    public int? MaxConcurrency { get; set; }
}
```

The developer can register the configuration within the startup sequence, as shown below:
```c#
services.ConfigureClassAware<ConcurrencyOptions>(configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"))
    .DynamicallyConfigureClassAware<ConcurrencyOptions>();
```

The image below shows the sample code where th concurrencyOptionsMonitor is injected into the constructor of the `WeatherForecastController` class and used into the `Get()` method.<br>

In this way, ConcurrencyOptions options will be overridable by means of the __`Dynamic-Configuration` http request header__.

The image below shows a call to the `S01_00_SampleWebAPI` sample api where `MaxConcurrency` value `10` is loaded from the `appSettings.json`:

The output log below shows the `MaxConcurrency` value of `10` read from the `appSettings.json` configuration file:

The image below shows a call to the `S01_00_SampleWebAPI` sample api where `MaxConcurrency` value is overridden to 1 by means of the `Dynamic-Configuration` http request header:

The output log below shows the `MaxConcurrency` value of `1` overridden by means of the `Dynamic-Configuration` http request header:
