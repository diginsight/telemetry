# HowTo: Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance and telemetry cost 

## Introduction 
Diginsight brings __application behavior observability__ to the next step.<br>
In particular The '__full application flow__' is made available to local text based streams such as the '__Console log__' or the '__Streaming log__'.<br> 
The same information can be made available to '__remote tools__' for troubleshooting or performance analysis such as '__Azure Monitor__' or '__Grafana__'.<br>

The following example shows the execution flow of a Web API call, .<br>

The call shows a REST http call landing on `PlantsController.GetPlantsAsync()` method in turn invoking a `api/Users/getUsers` endpoint on an external endpoint.<br>
than calling a `PlantsController.GetPlantsImplAsync()` method in a loop.<br>

The following image shows the same call log4net file log with full detail of the call flow.<br>:

In the following paragraphs we'll understand how this `observability` can be obtained without impact on the application performance.<br>

Also, you will soon learn that diginsight can be of great help with identifying and reducing `high latency flows` and `redundant flows` within the application execution paths.<br>

So diginsight can greatly contribute to application performance optimization more than provide a limitation to it.

We explore __how we can make our application flow fully observable__.<br><br>

## Performance considerations
The following image defines key drivers used by diginsights to avoid performence impacts:
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/002.01 - performance drivers.png>)


### Driver n°1: No heap pressure when disabled
The following code snippet shows a method instrumented by means of __diginsight__ `System.Diagnostics` __activities__:
```c#
public async Task<IEnumerable<Plant>> GetPlantByIdCachedAsync(Guid id)
{
    using var activity = Program.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, () => new { id });

    // Method implementation
    // ...

    activity?.SetOutput(plants);
    return plants;
}
```

When __disabling an activity source__, the activities for it are not created and `StartMethodActivity` returns `null`.<br>
Also, if __delegate notation__ is used to provide the `StartMethodActivity` payload, in case __logging__ or __payload rendering__ are disabled, the delegate is not used and __the payload class is not allocated__ into the heap.

![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/003.01 No heap pressure.png>)

In such conditions, diginsight activities are __not at all generated or used__ and do not provide any performance impact to the overall application.

### Driver n°2: No processing for disabled logs 
Needless to say, when log is disabled, method payloads are not processed at all and no strings are generated for method spans __start__ and __completion__.

Also intermediate `logger.LogXxxx()` statements, when using `structured logging` notation do not involve any string composition.

```c#
public async Task<IEnumerable<Plant>> GetPlantByIdCachedAsync(Guid id)
{
    using var activity = Program.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, () => new { id });

    // Method implementation
    // ...
    logger.LogInformation("Plant '{Name}' ({Id}) accessed", plant.Name, plant.Id)

    activity?.SetOutput(plants);
    return plants;
}
```

### Driver n°3: Intelligent sampling can be used to limit data sent to the remote tools
Diginsight supports __intelligent sampling__ by means of `OpenTelemetry` sampling support.

With OpenTelemetry, a full execution within a component is identified as a __trace__.<br>
The image below shows an example __trace__ where all rows share the same __trace_id__.

![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/003.02 log4net application flow.png>)

When an exevution flow is selected for sending to the remote tools, __all the rows within the flow are sent__.<br>
When an exevution flow is omitted, __all the rows within the flow are omitted__.<br>
This way. __consistency and readability__ of data sent to the remote tools is ensured.<br>
Also, __data sent to the remote tools can be limited in size__, as well as its __cost__ and __performance impact__.

The image below shows an __end to end transation detail__ sent to the __Azure Monitor__:<br> 
All the transaction flow is sent, regardless of the sampling ratio configured for the application.
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/003.02 appinsight transaction.png>)

The configuration section below, specifies a `"TracingSamplingRatio": 0.1`.<br>
In such case, __only one execution flow should be sent__ to the remote tools, __out of 10__.

```c#
  "OpenTelemetry": {
    "EnableMetrics": true,
    "EnableTraces": true,
    "TracingSamplingRatio": 0.1,
    "ActivitySources": [
      "Azure.Cosmos.Operation",
      "Azure.Storage.Blobs.BlobBaseClient",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore",
      "Diginsight.*",
      "ABB.*"
    ],
    "ExcludedHttpHosts": [
      "login.microsoftonline.com",
      ".documents.azure.com",
      ".applicationinsights.azure.com",
      ".monitor.azure.com",
      ".b2clogin.com"
    ],
    "DurationMetricTags": [
      "widget_template",
      "site_name"
    ]
  },
```

On a production environment you may choose to keep a default __Sampling Ratio__ from __0.1__ to __0.4__
to ensure __minimal telemetry volumes and cost__ still allowing systems behaviours analysis (eg. average Latencies, metrics dashboards etc).<br>
__Dynamic Logging__ and __Dynamic configuration__ can be used to act on this parameter, for __limited intervals__ or for __specific execution flows__, __without need of application restart__.<br>
This will ensure Full troubleshooting support. 

> it is perfectly feasible to __operate on a production environment keeping telemetry cost below a threshold__ (eg. in our case we work at about 5%) of the overall infrastructure cost, still ensuring __full observability__ for troubleshooting of production issues.


### Driver n°4: Traces sent to the remote tools are higly configurable
Data sent to the remote tools can be configured by means of the `OpenTelemetry` section:
```c#
"OpenTelemetry": {
    "EnableMetrics": true,
    "EnableTraces": true,
    "TracingSamplingRatio": 0.1,
    "ActivitySources": [
        "Azure.Cosmos.Operation",
        "Azure.Storage.Blobs.BlobBaseClient",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore",
        "Diginsight.*",
        "ABB.*"
    ]
},
```
- `EnableMetrics` (def. true): specifies whether metrics are sent to the remote tools
- `EnableTraces` (def. true): specifies whether traces are sent to the remote tools
- `TracingSamplingRatio` (def. 1): specifies the __sampling ratio__ for data sent to the remote tools.
- `ActivitySources`: identifies the __activity sources__ enabled for sending data to the remote tools.

### Driver n°5: Metrics sent to the remote tools are higly configurable
With OpenTelemetry, every execution flow (__trace__) can be composed of multiple __spans__.<br>
Diginsight gathers automatically few simple metrics such as the __diginsight.span_duration__ that describes every single __method latency__.

The local troubleshooting tools show the __diginsight.span_duration__ metric at any __span completion__ row:
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/005.01 span and span_duration.png>)

Diginsights can be configured to send the `span_duration` metric to the remote tools.<br>
The following charts show diginsight `span_duration` metric for a few methods on an Azure Monitor dashboard:

| span_duration kql query | span_duration chart |
|--------|---------|
| ![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/005.02 span_duration query.png>) | ![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/005.03 span_duration chart.png>) |


`RecordSpanDurations` __class aware option__ can be used to specify specific methods for which __span_duration__ metric should be sent to the remmote tools.<br>

In particular, the `RecordSpanDurations` flag can be set at __namespace__ or __class__ granularity level.<br>
As an example, the configuration snippet below specifies that `RecordSpanDurations` flag is enabled only for `Microsoft` and `Diginsight` namespaces:

````json
"Diginsight": {
    "Activities": {
        "RecordSpanDurations": false,
        "RecordSpanDurations@Microsoft.*": true,
        "RecordSpanDurations@Diginsight.*": true
    }
}
````
### Driver n°6: Use Request level `dynamic Logging` to hot switch log levels on local troubleshooting tools
With diginsight, you can safely send __sampled telemetry__ to the remote troubleshooting tools.<br>
This allows capturing application behaviors and trends.<br>
Also, logging to the local troubleshooting tools can normally be kept at __Warning__ or __Information level__.<br>
This way, only __limited information is sent to the remote tools__ and also, __limited information is written to the local troubleshooting tools__.


The snippet below shows a normal configuration for a runtime environment where only Information or warning level is enabled for few logging categories:<br>
````json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Warning",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information",
    "Diginsight.SmartCache.Externalization.ServiceBus": "Warning",
    "*.BodyLoggingHandler": "Warning"
  }
},
````
The image below shows an application streaming log where only limited information is written about exceptional conditions:
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/006.01 application information logstream.png>)

In case specific troubleshooting is needed for an application behaviour you can use __dynamic logging__ to elevate application logging level for any logging category.

The image shows an example call to the server where LogLevel is elevated to Trace:
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/006.02 specific call with Log-Level Trace.png>)

This will result in the __full application flow__ being shown for the specific call:
![alt text](<20.00 - HowTo Use diginsight telemetry with no impact on Application performance an telemetry cost/006.02 specific call application flow.png>)

This way, a single call application flow can be easily __isolated and analized on a live server__, that is __processing other calls at the same time__.
