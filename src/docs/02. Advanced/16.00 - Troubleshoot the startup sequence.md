## Introduction

Application **startup sequences and static methods** often hide **critical bugs** that can be extremely difficult to detect and resolve. These issues normally occur before standard telemetry systems are active, leaving developers blind right when observability is needed.

## The Challenge

During application startup, several problems commonly occur:

- **Configuration issues**: Missing connection strings, incorrect resource access keys, or invalid settings
- **Static constructor failures**: Dependencies that fail silently or throw exceptions in static initialization
- **Timing problems**: Components attempting to access services before they're properly initialized

The root problem is **observability gaps**: standard telemetry infrastructure isn't active during startup, making these issues nearly impossible to diagnose.

## Diginsight Solution

Diginsight provides **observability for the whole startup sequence** by means `DeferredLoggerFactory`, a recording logger that captures all startup activity before the telemetry system is ready.<br>
When startup completes, all recorded logs are flushed to our configured telemetry targets.

**Key benefits:**

- **Complete startup visibility**: Every method call, configuration load, and potential failure is recorded
- **No telemetry gaps**: Recording starts immediately, before any other systems
- **Cross-assembly support**: Static methods and external dependencies can access logging

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Setup

Here's how to enable startup sequence observability in our application:
![alt text](<images/000.02 SampleWebAPIWithStartupSequence.png>)

```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Step 1: Create ObservabilityManager immediately
    using var observabilityManager = new ObservabilityManager();
    ILogger logger = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger(typeof(Program));
    Observability.LoggerFactory = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory;

    WebApplication app;
    using (var activity = Observability.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, new { args }))
    {
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

        // Step 2: Configure Diginsight and register for flush
        builder.Services.AddObservability(builder.Configuration, builder.Environment);
        observabilityManager.AttachTo(builder.Services);

        // Standard service registration
        builder.Services.AddControllers();
        builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
        builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

        // Step 3: Enable deferred logging flush during build
        builder.Host.UseDiginsightServiceProvider(true);
        app = builder.Build(); // Flush happens here

        // Configure pipeline
        if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseSwagger();
            app.UseSwaggerUI();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseAuthorization();
        app.MapControllers();
    }

    app.Run();
}
```

#### Step 1: Initialize Deferred Logging

Create the `ObservabilityManager` as the very first action in our `Main` method:

```csharp
using var observabilityManager = new ObservabilityManager();
ILogger logger = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger(typeof(Program));
Observability.LoggerFactory = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory;
```

**What happens here:**

- The `ObservabilityManager` creates a recording logger that captures everything
- No telemetry infrastructure is needed yet - this works immediately
- The logger starts recording all method calls, timing, and log statements

#### Step 2: Register for Automatic Flush

After configuring Diginsight with `AddObservability()`, register the manager to flush when startup completes:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddObservability(builder.Configuration, builder.Environment);
observabilityManager.AttachTo(builder.Services);
```

**What happens here:**

- `AddObservability()` configures our standard telemetry (OpenTelemetry, logging providers, etc.)
- `AttachTo()` registers a callback to flush recorded logs when the service container is built
- All deferred logs will be sent to our configured telemetry targets

#### Step 3: Enable the Flush

Use the Diginsight service provider to trigger the flush during application build:

```csharp
builder.Host.UseDiginsightServiceProvider(true);
app = builder.Build(); // Flush happens automatically here
```

**Result:** Our application startup logs will show every detail of the initialization process:

### Advanced: Cross-Assembly Access

For static methods or code in external assemblies that need logging during startup we can use the `ObservabilityRegistry`.

With Diginsight (or .net diagnostics) an `Observability` class is normally defined in each assembly that needs logging.

#### Enable Observability classes to receive LoggerFactories from ObservabilityRegistry
A simple static constructor can registers the Observability class to receive `LoggerFactory` objects from the `ObservabilityRegistry`:

```csharp
internal static class Observability
{
    public static readonly ActivitySource ActivitySource = new(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name!);
    public static ILoggerFactory LoggerFactory { get; set; } = null!;

    static Observability() => ObservabilityRegistry.RegisterComponent(factory => LoggerFactory = factory);
}
```

#### Register the LoggerFactory into ObservabilityRegistry

In our startup code, register the logger factory with the registry:

```csharp
using var observabilityManager = new ObservabilityManager();
ILogger logger = observabilityManager.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger(typeof(Program));

// Register globally for cross-assembly access
ObservabilityRegistry.RegisterLoggerFactory(observabilityManager.LoggerFactory);
```

#### Use the LoggerFactory in Static Methods

Now any static method can access logging during startup:

```csharp
public static FeedIterator GetItemQueryStreamIteratorObservable(this Container container, string query, string? continuationToken = null, QueryRequestOptions? requestOptions = null)
{
    var loggerFactory = Observability.LoggerFactory;
    var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger(typeof(CosmosDbExtensions));
    using var activity = Observability.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, () => new { query, continuationToken, requestOptions });
    
    // Method implementation with full observability
}
```

**Result:** Even static methods and external assemblies will appear in our startup logs:
