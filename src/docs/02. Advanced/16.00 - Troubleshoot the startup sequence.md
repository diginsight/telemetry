title: "Throubleshoot the startup sequence"
---

## Introduction 
The __most tricky__ or the __most critical__ __bugs__ are often hidden in the __application startup sequence__ or __application static methods__.<br>
As an example, startup configurations such as __connection string__ or __resources access keys__ may be wrong or missing.<br>
Also, __static contructors__ within the application or its dependencies may hide tricky bugs that are difficult to troubleshoot. 

Those places are usually __difficult to troubleshoot__ as telemetry may be not active when they are executed.

Diginsight telemetry enables __full observability also for these parts__ by means of the `DeferredLoggerFactory` that provides __recording the application flow__ until the telemetry infrastructure is set up.

Upon setup completion, telemetry recording is flushed right before the standard telemetry flow gathering so that any configuration problem or error can be made visible.

The code snippets below are available as working samples within the __telemetry_samples__ repository.

In particular the steps shown below explain how the startup sequence can be made observable on the `SampleWebApi` within the `telemetry_samples` repository.

## How to make the startup sequence observable

The following code snippet shows the startup method of the `SampleWebApi` project:

```c#
public static IDeferredLoggerFactory DeferredLoggerFactory;
internal static readonly ActivitySource ActivitySource = new(typeof(Program).Namespace ?? typeof(Program).Name!);

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    DiginsightActivitiesOptions activitiesOptions = new() { LogActivities = true };
    DeferredLoggerFactory = new DeferredLoggerFactory(activitiesOptions: activitiesOptions);
    var logger = DeferredLoggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();

    ActivitySource activitySource = new(typeof(Program).Namespace!);
    DeferredLoggerFactory.ActivitySources.Add(activitySource);
    DiginsightDefaults.ActivitySource = activitySource;

    IWebHost host;
    using (var activity = DiginsightDefaults.ActivitySource.StartMethodActivity(logger, new { args }))
    {
        host = WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration2()
            .UseStartup<Startup>()
            .ConfigureServices(services =>
            {
                var logger = DeferredLoggerFactory.CreateLogger<Startup>();
                using var innerActivity = ActivitySource.StartRichActivity(logger, "ConfigureServicesCallback", new { services });

                services.TryAddSingleton(DeferredLoggerFactory);
            })
            .UseDiginsightServiceProvider()
            .Build();

        logger.LogDebug("Host built");
    }

    host.Run();
}
```

a `IDeferredLoggerFactory` and an ILogger instance are created at startup, __immediatly after application start__:
```
DiginsightActivitiesOptions activitiesOptions = new() { LogActivities = true };
DeferredLoggerFactory = new DeferredLoggerFactory(activitiesOptions: activitiesOptions);
var logger = DeferredLoggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
```

__Dotnet logging is not configured or activated already__, however __logger instance is recording__ all activities START, END and all explicit logging operations.

Please, note that the logger factory is passed the `activitySources` that are used so that it can register as a listener to them.
```
DeferredLoggerFactory.ActivitySources.Add(activitySource);
```

the `Startup` `ConfigureServices` method __registers observability__ with `AddObservability()` method.<br>
Also, it __registers recorded telemetry flush__ with `FlushOnCreateServiceProvider()`.
```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
    services.AddObservability(configuration);
    services.AddDynamicLogLevel<DefaultDynamicLogLevelInjector>();
    services.FlushOnCreateServiceProvider(deferredLoggerFactory);
```

After services configuration, right __before the host build__, the telemetry and logging will be configured and activated.
The `UseDiginsightServiceProvider()` call will run the registered telemetry __Flush()__ and all the deferred logs will be flushed to the telemetry targets.

Api startup __will then show all logs recorded during startup__:
