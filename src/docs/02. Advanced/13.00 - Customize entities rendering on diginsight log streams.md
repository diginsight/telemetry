## HowTo: Customize entities rendering on diginsight log streams 

__Diginsight__ provides __automatic rendering__ for entities such as method __input payloads__ or __return values__.

Entities rendering is performed automatically for __simple types__ and also for __complex types__ with fields and properties.

This article discusses how __rendering is handled ensuring limited performance impact__ and how the developer can customize rendering for __its own entities__ or for __entities from other packages__. 


## Additional Information
For __simple types__ rendering is performed in automatic and intuitive way.
the image below shows log for DoSomeWork, StepOne and StepTwo methods that return integer values.

For __complex types__, by default, entities are rendered with their property values in the order chosen by the compiler.

### Customize properties rendering
The developer can use attributes `LogStringableMember` `NonLogStringableMember` to decide members to be shown with a specific order and members to be excluded from rendering.
The image below shows a custom entity where order is defined for members and where non relevant members are excluded by means of the `NonLogStringableMember` attribute:
