# Example analysis with diginsight
Troubleshooting with diginsight is easy and, for any application, it happens in similar ways.

## STEP 01: reproduce the problem and analyze the detail flow

The following image shows a diginsight application flow on a text based stream for `PlantsController.GetPlantsAsync` method.
The flow can be easily obtained from __developer machine log file__, or from `application live console` such as __Azure app streaming log__ or a __Kubernetes console log__:

Starting from its `traceid` (`0f83d3a1e2e834f4b8dab3f3f0f5bc12`), the same flow can be found as an __Azure Monitor Application transaction__:

From the image we can observe that __internal component calls are shown into the transaction flow__ and not just interactions across different components.<br>
Also, note that __the transaction flow structure is consistent__ with the transaction flow rendered on the live console log, where more detail is available.
Also, note that __the transaction flow structure is consistent__ with the application code as __class names__, __method names__, and __variable names__ are obtained automatically. 

Latencies for the same function can be analyzed in a chart with the `span_duration` metric, filtered on `DataAnalyticsReportsController.GetDevices` method.

In facts, the `span_duration` metric allows analyzing latencies of __any method__ within code.<br>

Also, we'll see that the developer can easily add __other metrics__ and __metric tags__ to split and compare values in different conditions (eg. by site properties, user properties etc)..<br>
